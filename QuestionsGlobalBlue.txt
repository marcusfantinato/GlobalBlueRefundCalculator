Dear Product Owner, I hope you are doing well.

I would like you to give me more information about the project.
I have some questions to finalize the Test Cases. Could you answer me?

1 - What is the calculation formula for Tax Refund?
I realized that it varies depending on Country and Values
 
2 - How is the minimum “Purchase Amount” defined?
I also realized that it varies depending on Country

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you.

I haven’t done the test cases for testing the refund calculation, Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value analysis because of lacking above information
